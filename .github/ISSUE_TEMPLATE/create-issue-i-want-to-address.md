⚠️⚠️BEFORE WE GET STARTED⚠️⚠️

This is not the right place to report product defects with customer impact to Microsoft! Issues created in this repository won't get picked up by the Microsoft engineering team and issues reported in this repository do not fall under SLAs (Service Level Agreements) and hence have no guaranteed time to mitigation, just as provided fixes won't get backported to all supported versions of the product.

- Please only create issues you intend to provide a fix for yourself.
- For larger contributions, please don't create an issue. Rather follow the process for feature contributions.

💡 Read more about what and how to submit in the CONTRIBUTIONS document of this repository: https://github.com/microsoft/BusinessCentralApps/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md.
