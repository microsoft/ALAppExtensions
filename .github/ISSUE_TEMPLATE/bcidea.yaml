        Thanks for taking the time to create a BC Idea issue!

        ⚠️⚠️ BEFORE WE GET STARTED ⚠️⚠️
        Please do not create an issue for a BC Idea unless you intend to implement it yourself. If you are not planning to implement the BC Idea yourself, please go to aka.ms/bcideas and upvote the feature on BC Ideas instead. 

        Before you create a new issue please:
        🔎 Search existing issues to avoid creating duplicates.
