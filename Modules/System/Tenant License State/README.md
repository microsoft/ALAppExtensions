This module provides methods for retrieving the current state of the tenant license, and the start and end dates of the license.

Use this module to do the following:
- Get the start date or the end date of the current license.
- Check whether the license state is evaluation, trial, or suspended.
- Check whether the trial period has been extended.
- Check whether the current license is paid, suspended, or warning.

For on-premises versions, you can also use this module to extend the period for a trial license.
