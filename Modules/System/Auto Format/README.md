This module provides methods for formatting the appearance of decimal data types in fields on tables, reports, and pages.

Use this module to do the following:
- Format decimals for text messages in the same way that the system formats decimals in fields.
- Get the default rounding precision.

For on-premises versions, you can also use this module to personalize expressions for formatting data.
