    "description":  "Inventory management is a trade-off between customer service and managing cost. On one hand, low inventory levels require less working capital. On the other hand, stock-outs can lead to missed sales. The Sales and Inventory Forecast extension uses historical data to predict potential sales so you know when to expect stock-outs. Based on the forecast, the extension saves you time by helping to create replenishment requests to your vendors.",
