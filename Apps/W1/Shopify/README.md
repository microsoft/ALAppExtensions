Connect your Shopify store (or stores) with Business Central and maximize your business productivity. Manage and view insights from your business and your Shopify store as one unit.

## Product Help
The functionality in the default version of Business Central is described on the docs.microsoft.com site. The [Shopify](https://learn.microsoft.com/dynamics365/business-central/shopify/get-started) section offers descriptions of processes, such as synchronizing products and orders, and conceptual information about mapping various entities.
You can also explore the [FAQ](https://aka.ms/bcshopifyfaq) and a collection of [walkthroughs](https://learn.microsoft.com/dynamics365/business-central/shopify/walkthrough-setting-up-and-using-shopify) (how-to).

## Extensibility

The Shopify Connector offers a few points of extensibility. We are keeping the number of points to a minimum so that we can follow the rapid development on the Shopify side without introducing breaking changes. However most important scenarios are covered. For more details and examples, see [Extend the Shopify Connector](https://learn.microsoft.com/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/devenv-extending-shopify).
Instead of building modifications as extensions, we suggest exploring if you can contribute code to the Shopify Connector through a co-development process.
