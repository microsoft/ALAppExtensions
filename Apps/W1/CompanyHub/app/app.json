    "description":  "Company Hub gives you a list of the companies you work in. You can easily add new companies by just providing a URL and a name for the company. The list of companies contains a few KPIs for the company that is displayed for the user if they have the needed access. You also have a list of assigned user tasks for a given company, so you can keep track of work required for each company. The Company Hub gives you either a dedicated Company Hub role center (if you use one tenant as the main access point) or a similar task page if you use the Company Hub from within a company where your role requires you to have a different main role center. Both have the same features and the same easy access to the companies you work in.",
