  "description": "QR-bills enable easier processing and payment of received invoices from vendors. The QR-Bill Management app for Switzerland allows you to generate QR-bills that are compliant with the Swiss standard to receive QR-bills either via file import or direct input scan. All received QR-bills are handled via the Incoming Documents feature from where purchase journals can be created directly from the imported QR-bills. Finally, this app ensures that all payment references from  QR-bill are carried through SEPA files to and from the bank and back to the issuer of the QR-bill for easy reconciliation. With this app, you can easily comply with the Swiss requirements for the QR-bills.",
