# What scenarios are available?
Please take a look at the BCPT scenario codeunits in the [src](./src) folder. 

If you need to test other scenarios than these for your go-live, please consider writing scenario codeunits for them and then adding them to this repository. If all projects do this, then we will slowly but surely get a good scenario coverage of the Business Central functionality.
